# DM_Perfornance
A function that takes signal and background anomaly scores and returns the area under the ROC curve, and the Z score at three different background efficiencies.

Takes signal and background weights as an optional variable.

Takes approximately 10-30 minutes to run depending on the size of the signal/background and on the shape of the distributions.
